# Getting Started with Your Gemini Capsule

Welcome to your new Gemini capsule! This guide will help you create your first content.

## Understanding Gemtext

Gemtext is the markup language used for Gemini pages. It's much simpler than HTML:

### Text Lines
Regular text appears as-is. No special formatting needed.

### Headings
```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2  
### Heading 3
```

### Links
```
=> /page.gmi Link Text
=> gemini://example.com/ External Link
=> https://example.com/ Web Link (opens in browser)
```

### Lists
```
* List item one
* List item two
* List item three
```

### Quotes
```
> This is a quote
> It can span multiple lines
```

### Preformatted Text
```
```
Code or ASCII art goes here
Multiple lines preserved
```
```

## Creating Your First Pages

1. Create a new .gmi file in your gemini directory
2. Start with a heading using #
3. Add some text content
4. Include links to other pages
5. Save and refresh your browser

## File Organization

```
gemini/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.gmi          # Your homepage
â”œâ”€â”€ about.gmi          # About page
â”œâ”€â”€ blog/

â””â”€â”€ projects/
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.gmi      # Some other folder index
    â””â”€â”€ project1.gmi   # Individual projects
```

## Tips for Good Gemini Content
